# eif-submit

While the data, assets, and eif_map.py work as expected -- there are still some difficulties creating a reliable virtual environment for the app to run on. A problem I believe stems from a initial flaw I made when setting homebrew a few years ago. 

However, a webdeveloper with a proper developers environment should be able to create a stable virtual environment for the app using the environment.yml and requirements.txt files included in this repository.
